# Move and Rename Photos...This is Handy for Camera Trap Data

You will need to open this in R Studio. Modify the PhotoDir and the OutDir variables (lines 14 and 16) in quotes then press run. 

This code is simple and just moves files from within subfolders to a root directory (C:/ or an external hard drive D:/) giving the photo the name of all the folders the photo was in separated by underscores. It MOVES and does not COPY them. Be careful. 

The code is longer if we want the photos to go into a new subdirectory (e.g. C:/Photos), so this is why the OutDir needs to be either a root directory on your computer or an external hard drive. They should be easy to move in bulk to a new folder in windows explorer after they are renamed. 

WARNING: THIS CODE MOVES FILES ON YOUR MACHINE AND THERE IS NO UNDO BUTTON. 

MAKE A COPY OF YOUR FOLDER BEFORE YOU TEST IT UNTIL YOU GET USED TO WORKING WITH IT!!!
